# imaging-service-request-ig
The DICOM Modality Worklist (MWL) service provides DICOM acquisition devices with information from the ordering system (patient, visit, procedure, etc.).

The mapping between HL7 V2 and DICOM Modality Worklist (MWL) is well-defined. However, the mapping from equivalent FHIR resources is not.

This IG is intended to bridge this gap.
